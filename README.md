# firefox-link-extension

A simple extension which executes a get request with the currently selected
tab url to a server url of your choice.

### TODO
1. ~~Add open shortcut? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Popups~~
2. Animate success/Failure of request by adding some sort of icon afterwards.______
3. ~~Add an options page to config server~~
4. make it easier to find the options to set the server? Possibly in right click menu?
5. Make popup look smoother
6. Execute a post request to selected URL with content.
