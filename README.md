# firefox-link-extension

A simple extension which executes a get request with the currently selected
tab url to a server url of your choice.

### TODO
1. Add open shortcut? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Popups
2. Animate success/Failure of request by adding some sort of icon afterwards.______
